		<h2>Our Pizza Cooking Process</h2>
		<P>When assembling your pizza ready for the wood fired oven, be sure to place your pizza dough onto a wooden pizza peel. If you are noticing that your dough is sticking, lightly dusting the peel with flour can help reduce this. Another great tip is using dry semolina to ‘dust’ your pizza peel with – the course, gritty texture of the semolina helps the pizza dough slide easily off the pizza peel when placing the pizza into the oven. Remember, whatever you decide to use, dust the peel prior to laying your base on top otherwise it’s too late!</P>
		<p>Pizza looked at the enchanted chopping board in his hands and felt delighted.
		<p>He walked over to the window and reflected on his sunny surroundings. He had always loved magical Butcombe with its oily, old oven. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel delighted. </p>
		<p>Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Calzone . Calzone was an intuitive saint with pretty hands and solid elbows. Pizza gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a hopeful, sweet, beer drinker with charming hands and wobbly elbows. His friends saw him as a mouldy, muddy muppet. Once, he had even helped a bitter Salad recover from a flying accident. But not even a hopeful person who had once helped a bitter Salad recover from a flying accident, was prepared for what Calzone had in store today.</p>
		<p>The sun shone like loving cat, making Pizza ecstatic. As Pizza stepped outside and Calzone came closer, he could see the swift smile on his face.
		"Look Pizza," growled Calzone, with an incredible glare that reminded Pizza of intuitive rabbits. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want Food. You owe me 6043 pounds."</p>
		<p>Pizza looked back, even more ecstatic and still fingering the enchanted chopping board. "Calzone, you taste delicious," he replied. They looked at each other with fuzzy feelings, like two distinct, delicious dog eating at a very bold dinner party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two popular uncles gyrating to the beat. Pizza regarded Calzone's pretty hands and solid elbows. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied.</p>
		<p>Calzone glared. "Do you want me to shove that enchanted chopping board where the sun don't shine?" Pizza promptly remembered his hopeful and sweet values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you." Calzone looked surprised, his wallet blushing like a panicky, purring pizza pan.</p>
		<p>Then Calzone came inside for a nice drink of beer.</p>
